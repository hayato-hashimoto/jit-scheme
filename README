jit-scheme is an experemental JIT compiler for (for now subset of) Scheme.
The goal of jit-scheme is to provide the true dynamic programming environment with fast-compiling fast-running type-aware JIT.

:Dependency:
 Chicken scheme: Make sure that you get the most recent version.
  $ apt-get install chicken
 Chicken eggs: matchable, srfi-38
  $ chicken-install matchable
  $ chicken-install srfi-38

:Compile:
  $ make

:Exec:
  $ ./jitscheme

:Example:
:infinite loop: (Omega Combinator)
test> ((lambda (a) (a a)) (lambda (a) (a a)))

:fibonacci numbers:
 test> (fn (fib)
   (set! fib (fn (n)
     (if (< n 1) 1 
       (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))))
   (fib 40))
